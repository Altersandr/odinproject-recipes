<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chocolate salami is an Italian and Portuguese dessert made from cocoa, broken biscuits, butter, eggs and sometimes alcohol such as port wine or rum. The dessert became popular across Europe and elsewhere, often losing alcohol as an ingredient along the way.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li>Dark chocolate</li>
    <li>Dry biscuits</li>
    <li>Rum</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Bitter cocoa powder</li>
    <li>Powdered sugar</li>
</ul>


<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol><li>To prepare the chocolate salami, first take the ingredients out of the refrigerator so that they are at room temperature. Chop the dark chocolate with a knife and melt it in the microwave or in a double boiler, then let it cool down. Meanwhile, pour the butter and sugar into a separate bowl and start working with whips.</li>
    <li><p>When you have reduced the butter to cream, pour the rum slowly while continuing to mix. Finally add the warmed chocolate, give a quick stir and also incorporate the bitter cocoa making sure to mix everything until you get a homogeneous mixture.</p></li>
    <li><p>Crumble the dry biscuits with your hands and add them to the chocolate mixture, then mix with a spatula to incorporate them evenly.</p></li>
    <li><p>Now take a sheet of parchment paper and pour the mixture into the center, shaping it with your hands to give it a cylindrical shape. Lift the bottom flap and wrap the parchment paper around the cylinder, then roll up the ends to seal it</p></li>
    <li><p>Transfer the roll to the refrigerator and let it harden for at least 2-3 hours. After this time, remove the parchment paper and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Your chocolate salami is ready to be sliced and enjoyed</p></li>
