<h2>Description</h2>
A muffin is an individually portioned baked product, however the term can refer to one of two distinct items: <p>a part-raised flatbread that is baked and then cooked on a griddle, or an quickbread that is chemically leavened and then baked in a mold.</p>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul><li>00 flour</li>
    <li>Almond milk</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Baking powder for cakes</li>
    <li>Dark chocolate chips</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Vanillin</li>
</ul>

    <li>To prepare the almond milk and chocolate chip muffins, put the softened butter in a large bowl, add the sugar and mix with electric whips until the mixture is thick and creamy.</li>
    <li><p>Add one egg at a time and incorporate it into the dough with an electric whisk; wait until each egg is completely blended before adding another. </p></li>
    <li><p>Pour the sifted flour into the bowl, the yeast, vanillin and almond milk and mix everything with the electric whisk</p></li>
    <li><p>At this point, add almost all the chocolate chips and mix with a spatula to incorporate them evenly into the mixture; the rest of the chocolate chips will be used to garnish the muffins. Transfer the mixture obtained into a sac-à-poche without a nozzle.</p></li>
